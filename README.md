2. Capture test results (pass/fail summary).  
3. Explain how AI improves test coverage over manual testing.  

**Deliverables:**  
- Test script  
- Screenshot of results  
- 150-word explanation  

---

### 📊 Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation  
**Dataset:** Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset  
**Model:** Random Forest / Decision Tree  

**Goal:** Predict issue priority (high / medium / low)  

**Steps:**  
1. Preprocess data (cleaning, encoding, splitting).  
2. Train and evaluate a model (accuracy & F1-score).  
3. Discuss insights from the results.  

**Deliverables:**  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Performance metrics (Accuracy, F1-score)  

---

## ⚖️ Part 3: Ethical Reflection (10%)  

**Prompt:**  
Imagine your predictive model (from Task 3) is deployed in a company. Discuss:  
- Potential **biases** in the dataset (e.g., underrepresented user groups).  
- How tools like **IBM AI Fairness 360** could mitigate these issues.  

> 📢 *Reflection Tip:* Focus on transparency, accountability, and fairness in AI-driven systems.
